        <h2>Lofty. <br>As.<br>Fuck.</h2>
        <p><strong>The Orzo Knight Foundation</strong> works toward a single goal: To bring about global peace and understanding. We do this by taking a pledge to be really fucking nice to everyone we meet, regardless of gender, race, religion, sexual preference, education, or even gaming platform. Everyone is equal in our eyes. Ok, almost everyone. We'll likely never be nice to <a href="http://trumpdonald.org/" alt="TrumpDonald.org" target="_blank">this guy</a>.</p>

            <h2>A Story</h2>
            <h3>NOT OURS, JUST A STORY </h3>

            <p>People can be real bastards. It's true, and anyone who has lived in this world for more than 10 minutes can attest to this fact. It's as yet unclear why people are such bastards, and our scientists are working around the clock to solve this mistery<sup>*</sup>. </p>

            <p>Out of this ocean of bastardness was born the idea for a new kind of organization, one which was not bound by the rules of society, propriety, or even physics<sup>**</sup>. A virtual safe haven where people could be themselves without fear of judgement or discrimination. These ideals are the pillars on which the mission of the Orzo Knight Foundation was built. </p>

            <p>The Orzo Knight Foundation is not organized religion. It is not a cult or a self-help program. It is not even a foundation. Instead, think of us as a collection of beneficent-sounding words, nicely arranged into paragraphs next to some peaceful-looking imagary on a website. We do not exist in the same plane of reality as you do; we exist only in your mind.</p>

            <h3>CYBERSPACE TO MEATSPACE</h3>

            <p>We do not venture into meatspace ourselves, we do it through your actions. So go be nice to someone, be <em>really fucking nice</em>, and do it for no reason; they'll never see it coming because they'll expect you to be a bastard just like them. Maybe tell them about the Foundation, but <strong>do not</strong> identify yourself as a member because we don't have members. That last bit is very important.</p>

            <h3>JOINING THE CAUSE</h3>

            <p>We're doing just fine, thank you. We don't need you coming in and trying to &ldquo;help&rdquo; by sharing your ideas and trying to change things. We like things the way they are, we are adverse to change. So stay over there on your side of the internet, be nice to people, and do good things all on your own. But you can't do it with us.</p>

            <p class="fine-print">* No they're not. We don't even have any scientists.<br>
              ** This is as untrue as is it impossible.</p>

          <h2>The pledge</h2>

          <p>I, [State your name], hereby pledge be <em>really fucking nice</em> to all those with whom I interact, even if I don't feel like it, and even if they're being real assholes. </p>

          <p>I furthermore swear that I will be especially nice to animals because animal cruelty is totally fucked up.</p>

          <p>I do this of my own volition, and hereby release the Orzo Knight Foundation, its members, and all its subsidiaries of all liability for any misfortunes I may encounter by trying to be nice to one of those bastards out there.</p>

          <p>Finally, I understand that this pledge works totally on the honor system because, let's be honest, who is going to police it.</p>

          <p>So help me [Insert your preferred diety, or leave blank for none].</p>

        <p>If you haven't figured it out by now, we're not a real foundation. These are all lies, so don't try to call us, don't try to figure out how to get involved, don't give us your money even though there's a donation link at the bottom. I don't know why anyone would still be reading at this point. </p>
